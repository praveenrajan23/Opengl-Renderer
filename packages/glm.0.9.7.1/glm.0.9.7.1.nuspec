    <description>GLM provides classes and functions designed and implemented with the same naming conventions and functionalities than GLSL so that when a programmer knows GLSL, he knows GLM as well which makes it really easy to use.

This project isn't limited to GLSL features. An extension system, based on the GLSL extension conventions, provides extended capabilities: matrix transformations, quaternions, half-based types, random numbers, procedural noise functions, etc...

This library works perfectly with OpenGL but it also ensures interoperability with third party libraries and SDKs. It is a good candidate for software rendering (Raytracing / Rasterisation), image processing, physic simulations and any context that requires a simple and convenient mathematics library.

GLM is written in C++98 but can take advantage of C++11 when supported by the compiler. It is a platform independent library with no dependence and it officially supports the following compilers: 
- Clang 2.6  and higher
- CUDA 3.0 and higher
- GCC 3.4 and higher
- Intel C++ Composer XE 2013 and higher
- LLVM 2.3 through GCC 4.2 front-end and higher
- Visual Studio 2005 and higher
- Any conform C++98 or C++11 compiler</description>
